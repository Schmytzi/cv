abstract = {Despite the success in identifying effects of common genetic variants, using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), much of the genetic contribution to complex traits remains unexplained. Here, we analysed high coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, to evaluate the contribution of rare genetic variants to 414 plasma proteins. The frequency distribution of genetic variants was skewed towards the rare spectrum, and damaging variants were more often rare. However, only 2.24{\%} of the heritability was estimated to be explained by rare variants. A gene-based approach, developed to also capture the effect of rare variants, identied associations for 249 of the proteins, which was 25{\%} more as compared to a GWAS. Out of those, 24 associations were driven by rare variants, clearly highlighting the capacity of aggregated tests and WGS data. We conclude that, while many rare variants have considerable phenotypic effects, their contribution to the missing heritability is limited by their low frequencies.},

	abstract = {High levels of estrogen are associated with increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer and have been suggested to also play a role in the development of ovarian cancer. Cancerogenic effects of estradiol, the most prominent form of estrogen, have been highlighted as a side effect of estrogen-only menopausal hormone therapy. However, whether high levels of endogenous estrogens, produced within the body, promote cancer development, has not been fully established.We aimed to examine causal effects of estradiol on breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer.Here we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization ({MR}) to estimate the effect of endogenous estradiol on the risk of developing breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer, using the {UK} Biobank as well as 3 independent cancer cohorts.Using 3 independent instrumental variables, we showed that higher estradiol levels significantly increase the risk for ovarian cancer ({OR} = 3.18 [95\% {CI}, 1.47-6.87], P = 0.003). We also identified a nominally significant effect for {ER}-positive breast cancer ({OR} = 2.16 [95\% {CI}, 1.09-4.26], P = 0.027). However, we could not establish a clear link to the risk of endometrial cancer ({OR} = 1.93 [95\% {CI}, 0.77-4.80], P = 0.160).Our results suggest that high estradiol levels promote the development of ovarian and {ER}-positive breast cancer.},
